# Prerequisites
 - `futures-rs` version 0.1.17
 - `rustc` 2018-04-29 nightly

# Format
Inside `src/bin` there's exercise files `exercise1.rs`, `exercise2.rs`, and so
on.  Each has instructions at the top with suggested code to read under `src/`
and functions to complete inline.  If you ever get stuck, there's always a
correponding `solutions?.rs` file in the same directory.

Recall that you can run a binary directly with `cargo`:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin exercise1 -- <args>
```
